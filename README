# Name Uniqueness Checker

This Python script checks the uniqueness of names in a transaction based on various criteria such as typos, nicknames, and middle names. It provides an integer code indicating the level of uniqueness between names.

## Features

- **Typos Detection**: Utilizes edit distance to identify names that are similar due to typographical errors.
- **Nickname Mapping**: Supports custom mappings of nicknames to identify related names.
- **Middle Name Handling**: Handles scenarios where names include middle names or initials.
- **CSV Configuration**: Loads nickname mappings from a CSV file for flexible customization.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Accepts CSV file path as a command-line argument for ease of use.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unique-name-checker.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install editdistance
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare a CSV file containing nickname mappings (`names.csv`):

   ```csv
   aaron,erin,ronnie,ron
   abbigail,nabby,abby,gail,abbe,abbi,abbey,abbie
   # Add more mappings as needed
   ```

2. Run the script with the CSV file path:

   ```bash
   python forter_challenge.py names.csv
   ```

## Example

```python
from forter_challenge import count_unique_names

result = count_unique_names("Deborah", "Egli", "Deborah", "Egli", "Deborah Egli")
print("Uniqueness Code:", result)  # Output: Uniqueness Code: 1
```

## Configuration

- **CSV File Format**: Ensure that the CSV file for nickname mappings follows the format (`original_name, nickname1, nickname2, ...`).

## Testing

To run unit tests:

```bash
python forter_challenge.py names.csv
```
